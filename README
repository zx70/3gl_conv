This is a program I wrote long time ago in Visual Basic 3, it can be easily converted to earlier VB versions.

Choose the "source" and "destination" languages, and go for the conversion.
At the moment only the Sinclair BASIC parser is complete, but the converter is modular, and you can extend it by providing your own.
The converter was successfuly tested to port programs to Turbo Pascal and GW-BASIC.  
When an equivalent function is not present, the generated program require a function/procedure which will have to be provided.
